For the course Machine learning, I have done a lot of work on each on various algorithms of machine learning. Each .ipynb file belongs to
a recitation in which I have practiced and got to know the algorithms better. The following topics were practiced: 
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Linear Algebra
- K-NN Classifier
- K-NN-Scaling, Minkowski & Mahalanobis Distance Metric 
- Probabilistic Inference on Bayesian Network & d-Separation Algorithm 
- HMM(Hidden Markov Models)
- Frequentist and Bayesian Learning for Binomial Distribution 
- Linear Regression - OLS 
- SGD Linear Regression & OLS Polynomial Regression 
- Naive Bayes Classifier 
- Logistic Regression 
- Support Vector Machine
